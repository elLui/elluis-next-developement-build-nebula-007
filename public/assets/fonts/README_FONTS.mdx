# Installing Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a great way to add custom fonts to your project. To get started, head over to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and find the fonts you want to use.

## Downloading the Fonts

Once you have found the fonts you want to use, you will need to download them. To do this, click the `+` icon next to the font you want to use. This will add the font to the "Selected Families" list on the right-hand side.

Once you have added all the fonts you want to use, click the "Download" button at the bottom of the "Selected Families" list. This will download a zip file with all the fonts you selected.

## Installing the Fonts

Once you have downloaded the fonts, you will need to install them. To do this, open up the zip file and double-click each of the font files. This will open up a new window that will allow you to install the fonts on your computer.

Once the fonts have been installed, they will be available to use in any program or app that supports custom fonts.

## Using the Fonts

Now that the fonts have been installed, you can start using them in your projects. To do this, simply select the font you want to use from the list of fonts in your program or app.

## Current Project Fonts

For this project, we are using Adobe Creative Cloud fonts due to licensing restrictions. These fonts are being inserted into the head of the project via the Adobe Creative Cloud API.
